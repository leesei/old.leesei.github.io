[Rules of basketball - Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rules_of_basketball)
The rules of early basketball strongly favor tall white player, then goal tending rule was introduced. Strong black players find their values and dignity by dunking into the face of white players. NCAA banned the dunk in 1967 for 10 years.
Three point shots was initially conceived by ABA, and was introduced to NBA in 1978. This is a game changer for the basketball circle. Short/non-strong players can practice the deadly three point shots and play a vital rule in the game. Players no longer wait under the basket for opportunities. Defenders have to move out to defense for long range shots.
