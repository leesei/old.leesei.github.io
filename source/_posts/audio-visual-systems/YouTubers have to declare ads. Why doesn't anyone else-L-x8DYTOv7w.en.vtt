00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.125 line:91%
Around the world, there are
regulations for "influencers",

00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:07.502 position:70% line:91%
for people with a large audience on platforms
like YouTube, or Instagram, or TikTok.

00:00:07.502 --> 00:00:11.151 position:63% line:91%
Those regulations make sure that
if someone is paid to endorse a product,

00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:14.218 line:91%
they have to declare that payment
to the people watching.

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:20.251 position:59% line:91%
But... why does no-one on TV, or film,
or anywhere else have to do that?

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.132 line:68%
What's up world?
It's your boy, TomReacts.

00:00:31.132 --> 00:00:34.370 position:69% line:68%
And today's lazy reaction video is sponsored
by <i>Disguised Gambling Game.</i>

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.323 position:63% line:68%
Level up in an endless series of battles
designed to create an addiction loop!

00:00:37.323 --> 00:00:40.539 position:75% line:68%
Then when the dopamine hits go away,
bring them back by paying money for loot crates!

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.784 position:59% line:68%
They look and feel like
a random slot machine, but in reality,

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:46.441 position:83% line:68%
they're rigged so you win just enough to keep you
feeding more and more money desperately into the game

00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:48.435 position:59% line:68%
until it drains all your bank accounts
and credit cards.

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.459 line:68%
It won't work on everyone,
but it'll work on a few people,

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:51.686 line:64%
and that's how they make a profit.

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:55.081 position:73% line:68%
It's like a casino, but without any regulation,
and children can play too!

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:57.544 line:64%
I am morally complicit in this!

00:01:01.218 --> 00:01:03.082 line:85%
What counts as advertising?

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:05.886 line:91%
That's not a rhetorical question,
it is genuinely up for debate.

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:08.316 position:64% line:85%
Take this song from nearly a century ago:

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:12.700 position:58% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>♪ Does the Spearmint lose its flavour
on the bedpost overnight? ♪</i></c>

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.740 position:69% line:91%
In the late 1950s, British singer-songwriter
Lonnie Donegan wanted to adapt that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.043 line:91%
into a more modern style —
at least, modern for the 1950s.

00:01:20.043 --> 00:01:22.297 line:91%
His cover became
the definitive version of the song.

00:01:22.297 --> 00:01:26.204 position:72% line:91%
It reached number 5 on the US Billboard chart,
number 3 on the UK charts.

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:29.172 line:91%
But the title and the chorus
aren't quite the same.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:33.387 position:63% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>♪ Does your chewing gum lose its flavour
on the bedpost overnight? ♪</i></c>

00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:36.882 line:91%
Chewing gum, not Spearmint,
because Spearmint is a trademark,

00:01:36.882 --> 00:01:41.571 position:56% line:91%
and in 1959, that might have counted
as advertising here in the UK,

00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:43.456 line:85%
and the BBC wouldn't play it.

00:01:43.456 --> 00:01:46.855 position:73% line:91%
The evidence for that's a little shaky,
Donegan also changed a lot of the other lyrics,

00:01:46.855 --> 00:01:51.637 position:69% line:91%
but in the same way, in 1970, the song <i>Lola</i>,
by the Kinks, was banned by the BBC,

00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:53.437 line:85%
because it mentioned a trademark.

00:01:53.437 --> 00:01:56.629 position:58% line:85%
<c.cyan><i>♪ And it tastes just like Coca-Cola ♪</i></c>

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:59.757 position:56% line:91%
A ban like that could be devastating
to a song's chance of success,

00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:03.459 position:64% line:91%
because back then, the BBC had a monopoly
on radio broadcasting.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.760 position:78% line:91%
Yes, there were pirate stations,
and others broadcasting from international waters,

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.810 position:67% line:91%
but in 1970, the UK itself had
no legal radio stations other than the BBC.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.179 position:69% line:91%
If you wanted your song to reach the charts,
you wanted BBC airplay.

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.352 position:63% line:91%
So lead singer of the Kinks, Ray Davies,
had to fly back from America

00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:21.486 line:91%
to the UK, where the album's
master recordings were,

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:23.439 position:66% line:85%
re-record those lyrics for a radio edit...

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.781 position:61% line:85%
<c.cyan><i>♪ And it tastes just like cherry cola ♪</i></c>

00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:29.272 position:61% line:91%
...and then fly straight back to the US
on the same day,

00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:31.042 position:75% line:85%
so he didn't interrupt the band's American tour.

00:02:31.042 --> 00:02:33.864 position:61% line:91%
It's a pretty seamless edit,
the vocal quality's a little different,

00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:36.178 position:58% line:85%
but chances are no-one would spot it.

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:41.080 position:63% line:91%
Back in the 1970s, you could not mention
trademarks or company names in songs

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.531 line:85%
if you wanted airplay over here.

00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:46.067 position:63% line:91%
The BBC was funded through an annual tax
on owning a radio or television,

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.245 line:85%
they were not allowed commercials,

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:50.984 line:91%
and the logic was that maybe
someone might have been paid

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:53.385 position:70% line:85%
for that reference to Spearmint or Coca-Cola,

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:57.467 position:56% line:91%
and thus would have managed to sneak
advertising onto the BBC.

00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:00.001 position:63% line:85%
These days, they've relaxed their rules.

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.821 line:91%
Partly because deals like that
rarely happen for song lyrics.

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:05.251 line:91%
There are exceptions,
like pop star Pitbull,

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:08.312 position:56% line:91%
who did adverts for a camera company
and then gave them a shoutout:

00:03:08.312 --> 00:03:12.027 position:64% line:68%
<c.yellow>♪ Yeah right, picture that with a Kodak /
Take a picture of me with a Kodak ♪</c>

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:14.299 line:91%
Strong move there to rhyme
the brand name with itself.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.260 position:77% line:91%
Or maybe a pop star part-owns an alcohol company,
and then puts that company into their lyrics.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.154 line:85%
Like Pitbull.

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:22.724 line:85%
But leaving those rare cases aside,

00:03:22.724 --> 00:03:26.457 position:73% line:91%
a product reference in the lyrics of a pop song
is usually just that: a reference.

00:03:26.457 --> 00:03:30.001 line:91%
People have written hit songs
entirely about products and brands.

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:31.607 position:59% line:64%
<c.yellow>♪ Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang ♪</c>

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:35.570 line:64%
<c.cyan>♪ It's fun to stay at the Y-M-C-A ♪</c>

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.477 line:91%
But the companies didn't pay
for those references,

00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:40.907 position:75% line:91%
and the companies definitely didn't have control
over those references,

00:03:40.907 --> 00:03:44.413 position:69% line:91%
so I think pretty much everyone would agree:
not advertising.

00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:49.283 position:61% line:91%
Those two factors, payment and control,
are what define advertising.

00:03:49.283 --> 00:03:51.041 line:85%
Now, the lines aren't always clear.

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:55.261 position:84% line:91%
It's standard practice in car journalism
for reviewers to be given cars to test drive for free.

00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.252 position:64% line:91%
It's unreasonable for a journalist to buy
a brand-new car for each review,

00:03:58.252 --> 00:04:01.617 position:59% line:91%
so often, manufacturers will lend them
one for a few days,

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:04.023 line:91%
on the expectation that they'll get
a review out of it.

00:04:04.023 --> 00:04:07.129 line:91%
It's a perk of the job.
Is that payment?

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.842 position:72% line:91%
If that journalist writes too many bad reviews
about a particular car company,

00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:12.441 position:58% line:91%
or they've got a reputation for being
really honest or tough,

00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:15.413 position:70% line:91%
maybe they won't be quite as high on the list
for free test drives next time.

00:04:15.413 --> 00:04:18.324 line:91%
Is that control?
Does that count as an advert?

00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:21.284 line:91%
What about, if instead of
just being delivered the car,

00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:24.333 position:56% line:91%
the journalist — or the influencer —
is flown off first-class

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.652 line:91%
to some tropical location,
all-expenses paid,

00:04:26.652 --> 00:04:28.344 position:59% line:85%
and spends half a day driving the car 

00:04:28.344 --> 00:04:30.340 line:91%
and another couple of days
on a beach somewhere?

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.990 line:85%
The slang for that is a "junket",

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.998 position:66% line:91%
and it is a surprisingly common occurrence
in quite a few industries.

00:04:34.998 --> 00:04:38.229 line:91%
Can a journalist be trusted to give
an unbiased review after that?

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.015 line:85%
Would that be an advert?

00:04:40.015 --> 00:04:42.660 position:56% line:91%
Incidentally, this is why
when I get invited to try a jetpack,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.349 line:91%
or a wingsuit tunnel,
or something like that,

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.321 position:78% line:85%
I almost always start the video with the phrase...

00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:47.589 line:85%
"I got an email..."

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:50.247 line:91%
And I make clear what's happened.
Or at least, I think I do.

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:52.450 line:91%
I paid my own way there,
didn't take any money from them,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.980 position:66% line:91%
didn't run the video past them afterwards,
they had no control over what I said.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.743 position:61% line:85%
If I'd been injured, I'd have shown it.

00:04:58.743 --> 00:05:01.875 line:91%
In the past, I have made
public-relations people angry

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:04.301 position:69% line:85%
because I didn't tell the story they wanted.

00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:08.566 position:75% line:91%
Do videos like that count as adverts?
I don't think so, the regulators don't think so.

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:12.087 position:56% line:91%
but that wingsuit tunnel did give me
a day's training for free.

00:05:12.087 --> 00:05:14.781 position:72% line:85%
Everyone draws the line of what's "acceptable"

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.046 line:91%
just beneath
what they're doing themselves.

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:20.553 line:91%
That's why I'm mocking sponsorships
from gambling companies, but...

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:24.641 position:64% line:91%
I'm not mocking the basic idea of
YouTube creators doing sponsorship reads.

00:05:24.641 --> 00:05:25.984 line:85%
'Cause I've done those!

00:05:25.984 --> 00:05:30.861 line:91%
And everyone draws the line
just below what they're doing.

00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:32.537 line:85%
Payment and control.

00:05:32.537 --> 00:05:34.576 line:91%
Those are the factors
that make something into an advert.

00:05:34.576 --> 00:05:36.836 line:91%
And around the world,
the regulators are clear:

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:41.131 position:69% line:91%
if you're an influencer on YouTube,
or Instagram, or TikTok, or anywhere online,

00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:44.938 position:58% line:91%
and what you're producing has payment
or control by someone else,

00:05:44.938 --> 00:05:47.208 line:85%
you have to declare that.

00:05:50.748 --> 00:05:52.981 position:58% line:8%
Hey guys, just want to tell you about
these new Auntie Maggie detox teas.

00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:55.940 position:56% line:8%
They're guaranteed never to fail.
They cure lumbago, rheumatics, gout.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.544 line:8%
And I'll be drinking these
for the next six months because...

00:05:59.544 --> 00:06:01.648 position:72% line:8%
because the money from that reality show I did
is really starting to run out.

00:06:01.648 --> 00:06:04.287 position:58% line:8%
If anyone knows any casting producers
<i><b>please DM me.</b></i>

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:08.274 position:63% line:91%
I think the gold standard of influencers
declaring how they've been influenced

00:06:08.274 --> 00:06:12.602 position:66% line:68%
would be Nikkie de Jager, a Dutch YouTuber
who mainly creates makeup tutorials.

00:06:12.602 --> 00:06:14.475 line:64%
Okay, maybe not the gold standard,

00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:17.384 position:67% line:68%
because using white text
on a nearly-white background is ridiculous,

00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:19.927 align:end position:100% line:64%
but if I boost the contrast there a lot...

00:06:19.927 --> 00:06:23.939 align:end position:100% line:68%
She has specific icons that she uses
when she introduces each makeup product.

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:26.755 align:end size:97% position:97% line:68%
Has she bought it herself?
Has she been sent it for free?

00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:29.997 position:61% line:68%
Because in that case there is payment —
getting stuff for free counts —

00:06:29.997 --> 00:06:31.906 line:85%
but there's not much control.

00:06:31.906 --> 00:06:34.896 align:end position:100% line:68%
Or has she been paid to promote it,
is it an advert?

00:06:34.896 --> 00:06:37.935 align:end position:100% line:68%
Or does she get a cut of sales using
an affiliate link in the description?

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.690 position:69% line:68%
And sure enough, every time she starts using
a product in a video,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.798 position:64% line:68%
one of those little icons pops up
to make sure her audience knows about it.

00:06:44.798 --> 00:06:47.547 line:91%
If someone's getting paid
for endorsing a product,

00:06:47.547 --> 00:06:50.609 line:91%
but their audience thinks
they're giving an unbiased review,

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:53.856 line:91%
that's... well,
maybe "fraud" is too strong a word,

00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:58.919 position:86% line:91%
but it's what the US Federal Trade Commission, the FTC,
would call an "unfair or deceptive act".

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:01.910 position:56% line:91%
I'm going to be talking mostly about
the US and UK in this video.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.924 position:72% line:91%
That's partly because I'm British
and I publish on YouTube, an American website,

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.239 position:67% line:85%
so those are the rules I have to deal with.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.179 position:67% line:91%
But it's also partly because they represent
two different ends of the scale

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:13.323 line:85%
of what's allowed and what isn't.

00:07:13.323 --> 00:07:18.345 position:91% line:91%
If you're in another country, your rules will probably sit
somewhere between those two extremes.

00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:20.867 position:66% line:85%
Anyway: recommending a particular product,

00:07:20.867 --> 00:07:23.955 line:91%
without disclosing that you've got
a financial incentive to do so,

00:07:23.955 --> 00:07:26.519 position:63% line:85%
is considered lying for commercial gain.

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:29.940 line:91%
And in the US, that's something
that the FTC can regulate.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.483 position:58% line:91%
They have guidance for "influencers",
which says:

00:07:33.483 --> 00:07:37.777 position:64% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>Make it obvious when you have a personal,
family, or employment relationship</i></c>

00:07:37.777 --> 00:07:39.658 line:85%
<c.cyan><i>or a financial relationship –</i></c>

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:44.153 position:80% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>such as the brand paying you or
giving you free or discounted products or services.</i></c>

00:07:44.153 --> 00:07:46.893 position:63% line:85%
And they really do mean make it obvious.

00:07:46.893 --> 00:07:49.204 line:85%
<c.cyan><i>Place it so it's hard to miss.</i></c>

00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:52.969 position:61% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>So, don't put it on an "About Me" page,
or at the end of the video.</i></c>

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:55.250 line:85%
<c.cyan><i>Use simple and clear language.</i></c>

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.962 position:67% line:91%
Now, in the US, "simple and clear language"
can just be you explaining it,

00:07:58.962 --> 00:08:00.831 position:63% line:85%
and the word "sponsored" is good enough.

00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:02.169 line:85%
The British regulators,

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.848 line:91%
of which there are three
with various different remits,

00:08:04.848 --> 00:08:06.014 line:85%
are a bit more strict.

00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:09.455 position:83% line:91%
If the brand you're working with here has any control
over part of what you're posting,

00:08:09.455 --> 00:08:11.505 line:91%
even just checking it through
and approving it,

00:08:11.505 --> 00:08:13.969 line:85%
then that part becomes an advert:

00:08:13.969 --> 00:08:17.714 position:59% line:91%
"sponsored" is not a good enough word,
it has to be "advert" or "ad".

00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:22.065 position:77% line:91%
And if the whole video is an advert,
your audience needs to know it before they click.

00:08:22.065 --> 00:08:24.054 position:64% line:85%
It's got to be in the title or thumbnail.

00:08:24.054 --> 00:08:26.995 line:91%
The one common thread
in all these regulations

00:08:26.995 --> 00:08:31.721 position:83% line:91%
is that every influencer is expected to make it clear
when they've been paid to say something,

00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:34.960 position:58% line:91%
or wear something,
or even have something just in frame.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.728 position:84% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>Simply posting a picture of a product in social media,
or a video of you using it,</i></c>

00:08:39.728 --> 00:08:42.535 line:91%
<c.cyan><i>could convey that you like
and approve of the product.</i></c>

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:44.708 line:85%
<c.cyan><i>If it does, it's an endorsement.</i></c>

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:48.776 position:61% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>You don't necessarily have to use words
to convey a positive message.</i></c>

00:08:48.776 --> 00:08:51.126 line:91%
As a side note, that's also in
the terms of service for YouTube.

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:53.332 line:91%
If your video has paid promotion,
you have to tick a box.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.424 line:91%
That's partly to keep regulators
around the world happy.

00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:57.264 position:72% line:85%
Partly so they can put up a notice to viewers,

00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:59.737 position:67% line:91%
but it's also so their systems can work out
what you're promoting

00:08:59.737 --> 00:09:01.793 line:91%
and make sure not to run
competing ads against it.

00:09:01.793 --> 00:09:04.452 position:70% line:91%
They're a private company, so they're allowed
to make those rules however they want,

00:09:04.452 --> 00:09:08.049 position:75% line:85%
but that's separate to what governments require.

00:09:08.049 --> 00:09:12.816 position:69% line:91%
And governments require that influencers
have to declare when they've been sponsored.

00:09:13.245 --> 00:09:17.074 line:91%
But that's a standard that doesn't
seem to apply to anyone else.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.743 line:0%
This is gonna be a really difficult
video to make.

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:26.965 line:0%
There are a lot of people
I need to apologise to.

00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:30.344 line:0%
But before that, I need to tell you
about these new wireless earbuds.

00:09:30.344 --> 00:09:33.520 line:0%
They sound like absolute garbage.
They don't fit in my ears properly.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.913 position:58% line:0%
And in two days' time, I will slip up
and post a photo on Instagram

00:09:36.913 --> 00:09:39.769 line:0%
of me in the gym
with my usual Apple AirPods in,

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:45.304 position:69% line:0%
but until then, I have been paid to tell you
that these are really, really good!

00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:50.144 position:67% line:91%
In American television shows,
characters will sometimes endorse a product

00:09:50.144 --> 00:09:52.296 line:85%
for no reason related to the plot.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.904 position:61% line:85%
Classy, I don't think anyone noticed(!)

00:09:56.904 --> 00:09:58.999 position:61% line:85%
But often, it is more subtle than that.

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:02.580 line:91%
MTV's <i>The Hills: New Beginnings</i>
is a constructed-reality show,

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:05.494 position:56% line:91%
it's a soap opera where
the characters are also real people,

00:10:05.494 --> 00:10:10.473 position:88% line:91%
where the boundary between genuine drama
and producer-written storylines is deliberately blurred.

00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:12.440 line:85%
And it's got product placement.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.786 line:85%
<c.cyan><i>♪♪ [instrumental pop music]</i></c>

00:10:18.965 --> 00:10:19.734 line:85%
<c.cyan><i>[music fades]</i></c>

00:10:19.734 --> 00:10:21.102 line:85%
If that was a YouTube influencer

00:10:21.102 --> 00:10:23.918 line:91%
putting lingering shots of
their make-up sponsor in a video,

00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:27.232 position:66% line:91%
that would absolutely need to be declared,
clearly and up-front,

00:10:27.232 --> 00:10:29.007 line:85%
both in the US, and in the UK.

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:30.427 line:85%
Remember the FTC guidelines:

00:10:30.427 --> 00:10:33.313 line:91%
you don't have to use words
to convey a positive message.

00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:36.655 position:72% line:91%
Although sometimes, they do anyway,
like when they product-placed some milkshakes.

00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:38.733 line:64%
<c.yellow>Boom, got your shake. Wow!</c>

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:40.607 line:64%
<c.cyan>Thanks, honey, my favorite.</c>

00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:44.215 line:91%
But that's on TV,
so the FTC is fine with it.

00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:47.726 position:63% line:91%
When they talk about television,
they phrase things a little differently:

00:10:47.726 --> 00:10:50.616 position:73% line:7%
<c.cyan><i>Product placement doesn't require a disclosure.</i></c>

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:54.671 position:73% line:91%
A different US government agency:
the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC,

00:10:54.671 --> 00:10:57.929 position:67% line:91%
does have some requirements for disclosure,
but they're minor.

00:10:57.929 --> 00:11:01.038 position:59% line:91%
<i>The Hills</i> can just put a few words
in the credits at the end of the show.

00:11:01.038 --> 00:11:02.727 line:85%
And that's all they need to do.

00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:06.628 position:63% line:91%
That's not clear, and it's not up-front.
It's hardly a disclosure at all.

00:11:06.628 --> 00:11:08.479 line:85%
What about in music videos?

00:11:08.479 --> 00:11:12.402 position:77% line:91%
Those are certainly brands associating themselves
with someone influential.

00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:16.856 position:83% line:91%
An Instagram influencer, being paid to post a picture
wearing a certain brand of headphones,

00:11:16.856 --> 00:11:20.486 position:56% line:91%
is required to put a big disclaimer,
maybe #ad on it,

00:11:20.486 --> 00:11:23.408 position:64% line:91%
even if they're not saying anything about
whether the product is good.

00:11:23.408 --> 00:11:26.587 line:91%
The FTC's rules for influencers
make that very clear.

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:31.869 position:83% line:91%
But a pop star, who is very, very clearly influencing
legions of fans, including a lot of kids,

00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:35.269 position:70% line:91%
doesn't have to declare anything
when they do the same thing in a music video,

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:37.512 line:64%
like DJ Khaled in <i>I'm the One</i>.

00:11:37.512 --> 00:11:41.883 line:68%
Or when they're promoting alcohol,
<00:11:39.329><c>like DJ Khaled in </c><i><00:11:39.330><c>I'm the One.</c></i>

00:11:41.883 --> 00:11:45.311 line:68%
Or promoting vaping,
<00:11:43.207><c>like DJ Khaled in </c><i><00:11:43.208><c>I'm the One.</c></i>

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:48.486 line:85%
There is—

00:11:58.981 --> 00:12:01.555 position:59% line:91%
There is an argument that the audience
understands what's happening there.

00:12:01.555 --> 00:12:04.869 position:67% line:91%
Yes, there is payment, and there's control,
and I reckon there's endorsement,

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:07.642 line:91%
but it's also clear that
a product placement is just that.

00:12:07.642 --> 00:12:11.054 position:73% line:91%
It'd be different if that was a factual TV show
about reviewing vape pens.

00:12:11.054 --> 00:12:13.499 position:63% line:91%
The argument goes that product placement
doesn't need to be declared

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:15.536 line:91%
in music videos
and other entertainment media

00:12:15.536 --> 00:12:17.750 position:67% line:85%
because the audience knows what's going on.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.542 line:85%
And that's what the FTC says.

00:12:19.542 --> 00:12:24.935 position:83% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>If what the host says is obviously an advertisement –
a disclosure probably isn't necessary.</i></c>

00:12:24.935 --> 00:12:28.571 line:91%
Because it's not confusing.
It's obviously an advert, right?

00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:31.864 line:91%
Well, it's time to play:
<i>Is This an Advert?</i>

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:36.475 line:91%
First clip is from sitcom <i>30 Rock</i>.
Is this a paid advert?

00:12:36.475 --> 00:12:39.429 line:68%
<c.yellow>These McFlurrys are amazing.</c>
<c.cyan>I know!</c>

00:12:39.429 --> 00:12:44.747 position:64% line:68%
<c.cyan>The soft swirl of vanilla,
and the hard crunch of candy and cookies.</c>

00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:47.199 line:68%
<c.cyan>You think they fight each other,
but no.</c>

00:12:47.199 --> 00:12:49.375 line:91%
That wasn't an advert,
according to the writers.

00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:52.326 position:59% line:91%
McDonald's didn't have a say in that,
the writers just thought it was funny.

00:12:52.326 --> 00:12:54.028 line:85%
How about this clip?

00:12:54.028 --> 00:12:57.185 line:68%
<c.yellow>We're not compromising
the integrity of the show to sell—</c>

00:12:57.185 --> 00:12:58.291 line:64%
<c.cyan>Wow, this is Diet Snapple?</c>

00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.214 line:68%
<c.yellow>I know, it tastes just like
regular Snapple, doesn't it?</c>

00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:02.141 line:64%
<c.green>I only date guys who drink Snapple.</c>

00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:05.856 position:67% line:91%
Yes, that was an advert. Product placement,
and a testimonial unrelated to the plot.

00:13:05.856 --> 00:13:09.207 position:66% line:91%
What about the show that inspired <i>30 Rock</i>,
<i>Saturday Night Live</i>?

00:13:09.207 --> 00:13:12.079 line:68%
<c.yellow>Now, what's this I hear
about an Angry Whopper?</c>

00:13:12.079 --> 00:13:15.743 position:56% line:68%
<c.cyan>It's like a Whopper, but it's spicy.
It's got onion rings in it.</c>

00:13:15.743 --> 00:13:17.035 line:64%
<c.yellow><i>In</i> it?</c>

00:13:17.035 --> 00:13:18.180 line:64%
<c.colorCCCCCC><i>[audience laughter]</i></c>

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.434 line:68%
<c.yellow>So it's an entree that
ate its own side dish?</c>

00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:24.111 line:85%
That was product placement.

00:13:24.111 --> 00:13:27.259 line:91%
<i>Saturday Night Live</i> have been doing
sponsored sketches for years now,

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:30.995 position:72% line:91%
and there's stories of them checking jokes
to make sure they don't offend their sponsors.

00:13:30.995 --> 00:13:33.856 line:7%
<c.yellow>I only use Farrow &amp; Ball.</c>

00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:36.193 line:64%
<c.cyan>Farrow &amp; Ball? I don't know that.</c>

00:13:36.193 --> 00:13:37.660 line:64%
<c.yellow>Oh, well you should.</c>

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.249 position:66% line:8%
<c.yellow>It's the British paint company that offers
unparalleled depth and col-oor.</c>

00:13:42.249 --> 00:13:43.835 line:85%
That sketch wasn't sponsored.

00:13:43.835 --> 00:13:46.029 line:91%
It was a complete surprise to
everyone at the paint company.

00:13:46.029 --> 00:13:48.062 position:59% line:85%
The writers just thought it was funny.

00:13:48.062 --> 00:13:51.275 position:61% line:91%
To the audience, there is no difference
between a gag

00:13:51.275 --> 00:13:54.857 position:72% line:91%
that's been written specifically for a company
and approved by that company,

00:13:54.857 --> 00:13:57.817 line:91%
where there is payment,
control, and endorsement —

00:13:57.817 --> 00:14:00.482 position:58% line:91%
and a gag where the writers
just put a company name in as a joke.

00:14:00.482 --> 00:14:03.470 position:70% line:85%
It is impossible to tell without researching.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:09.124 position:91% line:91%
But none of those shows have to add any sort of disclaimer
until the very end credits — if there's even one at all.

00:14:09.124 --> 00:14:10.618 line:85%
How about in cinema?

00:14:10.618 --> 00:14:13.723 position:58% line:91%
Well, James Bond movies are notorious
for their product placement.

00:14:13.723 --> 00:14:15.406 position:59% line:85%
There's this scene from <i>Casino Royale.</i>

00:14:19.952 --> 00:14:21.276 line:85%
Or this scene from <i>Casino Royale.</i>

00:14:24.436 --> 00:14:25.945 line:85%
Or this scene from <i>Casino Royale.</i>

00:14:28.731 --> 00:14:30.159 line:85%
Those are adverts.

00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:32.352 position:69% line:85%
The film has been altered in exchange for...

00:14:32.352 --> 00:14:34.768 line:91%
Well, sometimes for money.
Sometimes for cross-promotion.

00:14:34.768 --> 00:14:38.520 position:72% line:68%
And occasionally they might be in exchange for
the boss getting a cameo in the film,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.983 line:68%
like Richard Branson appearing
in this scene from <i>Casino Royale.</i>

00:14:41.983 --> 00:14:46.236 position:73% line:68%
And yes, James Bond movies are famous for this,
but it happens in a massive amount of films.

00:14:46.236 --> 00:14:50.080 position:63% line:68%
Like that time <i>Superman</i> got paid $40,000
for shilling cigarettes,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.235 position:72% line:64%
and perhaps even more for sugar-filled drinks.

00:14:52.235 --> 00:14:54.250 position:67% line:64%
Strong choices for an all-ages movie there.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.555 position:63% line:91%
But there's no "contains paid promotion"
on any of those movie posters,

00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:00.243 line:91%
no title card letting the audience
know about it up front,

00:15:00.243 --> 00:15:02.141 line:85%
like influencers have to do.

00:15:02.141 --> 00:15:06.894 position:72% line:91%
Product placement in film was so normalised
as to be a joke in itself nearly 30 years ago.

00:15:06.894 --> 00:15:10.011 align:end size:97% position:97% line:45%
<c.cyan>Contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.</c>

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.982 position:59% line:68%
Sure, <i>Casino Royale</i> may put some names
at the end of the credits —

00:15:13.982 --> 00:15:17.798 position:70% line:68%
— but even if anyone was still watching then,
it's impossible to look at those credits

00:15:17.798 --> 00:15:20.691 line:68%
and tell how much payment
or control there was, if any.

00:15:20.691 --> 00:15:24.030 position:78% line:91%
The only reason I can be sure about it
is because of all the news articles that cover it.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.697 position:88% line:91%
The actual agreements are private between the filmmaker,
the companies, and their accountants.

00:15:28.697 --> 00:15:32.635 line:91%
Regulators all around the world,
they're all fine with that.

00:15:32.635 --> 00:15:35.309 line:91%
Product placement, you could say,
is not a lie.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.076 line:85%
It's not deceptive or fraudulent.

00:15:37.076 --> 00:15:41.540 position:66% line:91%
even with a full-on endorsement, it's just
a brand name appearing in entertainment.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.977 position:83% line:91%
Sure, it is an advert, but maybe there's a difference
because influencers are more trusted.

00:15:45.977 --> 00:15:48.899 line:91%
There can be this awful
parasocial relationship online

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:51.327 line:91%
where viewers think
they're the performer's friend.

00:15:51.327 --> 00:15:55.337 position:64% line:91%
So when an influencer endorses a product,
it sounds like a personal recommendation,

00:15:55.337 --> 00:15:57.988 position:64% line:85%
and therefore: that's a fraudulent claim.

00:15:57.988 --> 00:16:00.970 line:91%
But a character on a TV show?
Not the same, goes the argument.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.476 position:56% line:85%
No-one's going to be confused there.

00:16:03.119 --> 00:16:05.410 line:85%
I don't think it's so clear-cut.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:07.676 line:91%
First, you've got those
reality TV stars on <i>The Hills.</i>

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:10.649 line:91%
They are absolutely "influencers",
no matter where they appear —

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:12.963 position:73% line:85%
but the rules only apply to their social media.

00:16:12.963 --> 00:16:16.717 position:81% line:91%
And I'd argue that a character in a James Bond movie
saying that a watch is...

00:16:16.717 --> 00:16:18.603 line:68%
<c.yellow>beautiful...</c>
...is still an endorsement.

00:16:18.603 --> 00:16:21.869 position:70% line:91%
That character is portrayed as someone
who should be trusted about things like that.

00:16:21.869 --> 00:16:24.604 line:91%
If characters expressing opinions
didn't influence people,

00:16:24.604 --> 00:16:26.627 position:64% line:85%
companies wouldn't pay for the placement.

00:16:26.627 --> 00:16:27.805 line:85%
And after all...

00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:30.523 line:91%
I'm a character.
This persona is fictional.

00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:33.566 line:91%
Self-aware, sure, and based on
the real version, but fictional.

00:16:33.566 --> 00:16:36.672 line:91%
Tom Scott, the actual person,
is not like this off camera.

00:16:36.672 --> 00:16:38.836 line:91%
Could someone get around
the influencer regulations

00:16:38.836 --> 00:16:42.819 position:63% line:91%
by arguing that if they or their company
takes money to provide an endorsement,

00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:45.000 line:91%
it doesn't need to be declared
because on-screen,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.360 position:64% line:91%
they are playing an exaggerated character
who happens to have the same name?

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.825 line:85%
That sounds ridiculous,

00:16:50.825 --> 00:16:56.865 position:81% line:91%
but British TV presenter Lorraine Kelly once won
a court case over a million-pound tax bill that way.

00:16:56.865 --> 00:17:01.472 position:73% line:91%
Her lawyers successfully argued that she wasn't
being hired to present TV shows as herself,

00:17:01.472 --> 00:17:04.664 line:91%
but as a performer portraying
a character with the same name,

00:17:04.664 --> 00:17:08.320 line:91%
and thus the contracts fell under
a different set of tax rules.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.481 line:91%
Yes, there is an obvious,
clear difference between:

00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:14.491 position:61% line:91%
"putting a brand logo in the background
of a TV show" and

00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:17.912 position:75% line:91%
"this fake-friend has said that a thing is good,
and you should buy it".

00:17:17.912 --> 00:17:20.375 line:91%
If it was just those two clear,
distinct examples,

00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:22.633 line:91%
I think I'd agree with
the way things are right now.

00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:25.363 line:91%
But it's not that clear.
There are a lot of edge cases.

00:17:25.363 --> 00:17:28.451 line:91%
And the rules differ massively
based on the medium.

00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:32.720 position:86% line:91%
If you thought you were watching an entertainment show,
and it was actually advertising...

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.020 line:91%
Is that fraudulent?
Is that deceptive?

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.714 position:70% line:91%
And even if it isn't, is that something worth
keeping in check for the good of society?

00:17:39.714 --> 00:17:43.179 line:91%
The American government says no.
I'll talk more about that shortly.

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:46.790 position:58% line:91%
But the UK, and most Western European
governments, say yes.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.091 line:91%
Television shows imported here
over the Atlantic

00:17:49.091 --> 00:17:52.398 position:64% line:91%
sometimes need to have product placements
edited or blurred out,

00:17:52.398 --> 00:17:54.978 position:61% line:85%
because our rules are much more strict.

00:17:54.978 --> 00:18:00.281 position:91% line:91%
Except, I'm not sure those rules are always being followed
quite as much as they should be.

00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:03.070 position:73% line:85%
There is one more example I need to talk about.

00:18:06.312 --> 00:18:09.239 position:58% line:91%
Hey, folks! We're having a great time
here at Asbestos Land.

00:18:09.239 --> 00:18:12.186 position:66% line:91%
I've left the wife and kids

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:26.837 line:91%
Disney's theme parks
have an "influencer program".

00:18:26.837 --> 00:18:28.406 position:58% line:85%
If you post about Disney World a lot,

00:18:28.406 --> 00:18:31.726 position:63% line:91%
they might give you free passes
and invitations to special media events.

00:18:31.726 --> 00:18:35.631 position:63% line:91%
They even have an annual Moms Conference
for their top influencers.

00:18:35.631 --> 00:18:40.785 position:80% line:91%
All that sponsorship has to be declared, of course.
Particularly under the UK's strict rules.

00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:44.719 position:70% line:91%
There's absolutely no way that any influencer
could take large amounts of free stuff

00:18:44.719 --> 00:18:49.903 position:59% line:91%
and get special access like that
and not declare it very, very clearly.

00:18:49.903 --> 00:18:53.881 line:68%
Right?
<c.cyan><i>♪ Saturday! ♪</i></c>

00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:57.917 position:73% line:68%
<i>Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway</i>
is the last of the great British variety shows.

00:18:57.917 --> 00:19:00.050 line:68%
It's been running on and off
for nearly twenty years,

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.500 position:69% line:68%
but it's part of a UK broadcasting tradition
that goes back to the 1950s.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:09.183 position:78% line:68%
Stunts, skits, competitions, musical performances,
all in a shiny-floor studio, broadcast live.

00:19:09.183 --> 00:19:12.673 position:80% line:68%
It regularly attracts six or seven million viewers,
including a lot of families:

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:15.286 line:91%
that's about one in ten
of the British population.

00:19:15.286 --> 00:19:17.364 position:64% line:64%
The hosts, Ant and Dec, are so well-liked

00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:20.773 position:97% line:68%
that they've jointly won the British National Television Award
for best entertainment presenter

00:19:20.773 --> 00:19:22.956 line:85%
nineteen years in a row.

00:19:22.956 --> 00:19:25.119 position:69% line:85%
In the first episode of the show's 2020 run,

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:28.764 position:66% line:91%
they announced that the season finale
would be broadcast live from Disney World.

00:19:28.764 --> 00:19:30.899 line:91%
It wasn't, in the end, obviously,
the whole pandemic thing,

00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:33.537 line:91%
but they were planning to broadcast
live from Disney World.

00:19:33.537 --> 00:19:37.988 position:88% line:91%
Actually, they were sure to say the exact official name,
it'd be broadcast from...

00:19:37.988 --> 00:19:42.241 position:56% line:64%
<c.yellow>Walt Disney World Resort in Florida!</c>

<c.colorCCCCCC><i>[audience cheers]</i></c>

00:19:43.409 --> 00:19:45.376 position:66% line:85%
It's not the first time they've done that.

00:19:45.376 --> 00:19:47.986 line:91%
Their 2017 season finale
was also from Disney World,

00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:50.461 line:68%
and that time,
Disney provided a huge stage

00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:53.322 line:68%
in the middle of the Town Square
of Main Street USA.

00:19:53.322 --> 00:19:56.605 position:58% line:68%
That stage construction obstructed
the famous view of Cinderella Castle,

00:19:56.605 --> 00:19:59.367 line:64%
while the park was open, for days.

00:19:59.367 --> 00:20:03.455 position:81% line:91%
That is such a rare event that I can't actually find
any other example of when that's happened.

00:20:03.455 --> 00:20:06.406 position:59% line:91%
The production may not have been given
actual, cash-money profit

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:08.727 position:58% line:91%
from Disney or
their other sponsor, Virgin Holidays,

00:20:08.727 --> 00:20:13.080 position:58% line:91%
but clearly they got a huge amount of
free stuff and production support.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.584 position:59% line:91%
they had hundreds of vacation packages
to give away as competition prizes,

00:20:16.584 --> 00:20:21.231 position:73% line:91%
so they're clearly getting some form of payment
from their sponsors, and a lot of it.

00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:25.293 line:68%
<c.yellow>This is the biggest ever giveaway
on British television.</c>

00:20:25.293 --> 00:20:29.378 position:58% line:68%
<c.yellow>You heard me, madam, the biggest ever
giveaway on British television.</c>

00:20:29.378 --> 00:20:33.876 position:69% line:91%
Now, the UK regulations on product placement
are much, much more strict than the US.

00:20:33.876 --> 00:20:37.342 position:64% line:91%
There's no product placement in news
or children's programming allowed at all.

00:20:37.342 --> 00:20:41.705 position:78% line:91%
And on shows made in the UK,
you can't product-place alcohol or unhealthy food.

00:20:41.705 --> 00:20:44.967 line:91%
And there are also rules about
the way you can place products.

00:20:44.967 --> 00:20:48.889 position:63% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>The content of programmes shouldn't seem
to be created or distorted,</i></c>

00:20:48.889 --> 00:20:50.998 position:56% line:85%
<c.cyan><i>just to feature the placed products.</i></c>

00:20:50.998 --> 00:20:54.401 line:91%
So you can't create an entire show
just to sell Disney World tickets.

00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:56.237 position:78% line:85%
Okay, so let's give them the benefit of the doubt,

00:20:56.237 --> 00:20:59.640 position:69% line:91%
maybe the producers were looking for
somewhere spectacular for the season finale,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.327 line:85%
and Disney stepped up.

00:21:01.327 --> 00:21:05.922 position:70% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>Programmes also can't promote placed products
or give them too much prominence.</i></c>

00:21:05.922 --> 00:21:09.791 position:63% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>There shouldn't be any claims made about
how good a placed product is.</i></c>

00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:14.224 position:73% line:91%
So on British television, you're not allowed to
make product placement unduly prominent,

00:21:14.224 --> 00:21:16.230 line:85%
and you can't endorse the product.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.227 line:91%
That's an endorsement
in the first minute of the show.

00:21:21.227 --> 00:21:23.924 line:91%
And I think the product placement
is quite prominent

00:21:23.924 --> 00:21:28.208 position:69% line:68%
when they have a segment where they show off
the presenters having fun on the rides,

00:21:28.208 --> 00:21:33.361 position:84% line:68%
and another segment where their two junior presenters,
Little Ant and Dec, show off different rides.

00:21:33.361 --> 00:21:36.593 line:68%
Disney even put on a special parade
just for the show.

00:21:36.593 --> 00:21:39.419 line:68%
That sounds like a lot of
very promotional references to me.

00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:42.550 position:59% line:68%
It also sounds significantly off-beat,
but that's live broadcasting for you.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.951 position:63% line:68%
<c.cyan><i>♪♪ ["Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"

Those are trusted presenters,
having a great time at Disney World,

00:21:49.733 --> 00:21:53.332 position:73% line:91%
endorsing the theme parks to
the families watching, including a lot of kids.

00:21:53.868 --> 00:21:55.564 line:85%
But they're on television.

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:58.707 position:77% line:91%
so despite the UK's strict rules,
they didn't have to give a heads-up at the start,

00:21:58.707 --> 00:22:02.859 position:73% line:91%
or label the whole show #ad,
or make it clear that all this was advertising.

00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:05.687 position:61% line:91%
Many years ago, I made a video
about the UK's product placement rules,

00:22:05.687 --> 00:22:08.174 line:91%
and I said back then
how strict those rules were.

00:22:08.174 --> 00:22:12.113 position:75% line:91%
And yes, they are a bit more strict than the US,
but clearly not as much as I thought.

00:22:12.113 --> 00:22:14.786 line:91%
The show did have to do one thing,
under the UK rules.

00:22:14.786 --> 00:22:17.568 align:start position:0% line:68%
In the first few seconds,
they did declare their product placement here.

00:22:17.568 --> 00:22:19.929 align:start position:0% line:64%
You can see it in that first 2020 episode.

00:22:20.411 --> 00:22:23.635 align:start position:0% line:68%
It's the little P logo that was in the corner
of the screen for just a few seconds.

00:22:23.635 --> 00:22:26.230 position:66% line:91%
That's the UK's official product placement
declaration for TV.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.688 position:77% line:91%
That's all they needed to do.
Even under the supposedly strict British rules...

00:22:29.688 --> 00:22:32.279 line:91%
they just put that logo on,
and all that was fine.

00:22:32.279 --> 00:22:34.057 position:67% line:85%
I don't think that counts as a declaration.

00:22:34.057 --> 00:22:36.024 line:91%
How many kids told their parents
they wanted to go to Disney World

00:22:36.024 --> 00:22:37.673 line:85%

00:22:37.673 --> 00:22:41.362 position:61% line:91%
How many big, expensive Virgin Holidays
vacation packages were sold

00:22:41.362 --> 00:22:44.264 line:91%
to the millions of viewers
who didn't win the competitions?

00:22:44.264 --> 00:22:48.499 line:91%
How much did that 2017 show
"influence" the audience at home?

00:22:48.499 --> 00:22:50.089 position:66% line:85%
Well, we can answer that at least vaguely:

00:22:50.089 --> 00:22:53.318 position:66% line:91%
It must have had quite a bit of influence,
because three years later, Disney said:

00:22:53.318 --> 00:22:55.734 position:61% line:85%
"That was worth it, let's do it again."

00:22:56.216 --> 00:22:59.499 line:91%
But you could argue:
well, it's clear how this works.

00:22:59.499 --> 00:23:04.258 position:70% line:91%
obviously it's a—a collaboration with Disney.
The audience understands it.

00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:09.781 position:81% line:91%
But... that's before you start talking about
all the other products mentioned in an average show.

00:23:09.781 --> 00:23:11.982 position:64% line:85%

How many of those companies paid?
How many of them had control?

00:23:31.878 --> 00:23:34.069 line:91%
I don't know.
They don't need to say.

00:23:34.069 --> 00:23:36.693 line:91%
To be clear, I'm not saying
the show broke any regulations.

00:23:36.693 --> 00:23:40.949 position:73% line:91%
They weren't investigated, and I can't find any
serious complaints about any of the episodes,

00:23:40.949 --> 00:23:44.979 position:69% line:91%
other than one article on a tabloid web site
that aggregated a few forum posts.

00:23:44.979 --> 00:23:49.715 position:59% line:91%
If Ant and Dec were online influencers
rather than television personalities,

00:23:49.715 --> 00:23:54.233 position:72% line:91%
that whole Disney World show would have needed
a clear advertising disclosure,

00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:57.428 position:72% line:91%
possibly even a #ad
in the title of the video or in the thumbnail,

00:23:57.428 --> 00:24:01.084 position:59% line:91%
because Disney must have approved
and checked through what was going on.

00:24:01.084 --> 00:24:06.286 position:83% line:91%
I don't think Disney would have provided cast members
to perform classic songs with rewritten lyrics,

00:24:06.286 --> 00:24:08.617 line:68%
without having a sign-off
on what they were singing.

<c.yellow>♪♪<i> [in the tune of "Be Our Guest"]</i></c>

00:24:12.795 --> 00:24:17.281 line:91%
So we've got payment,
and control, and endorsement.

00:24:17.281 --> 00:24:20.806 position:64% line:91%
But they're on TV.
So one barely-visible letter P is enough.

00:24:20.806 --> 00:24:25.735 position:91% line:91%
Around the world, the regulations are more strict
for online influencers than they are for any other medium.

00:24:25.735 --> 00:24:29.427 position:83% line:91%
And normally, around this point in a video like this,
I would switch from "fact" to "opinion",

00:24:29.427 --> 00:24:32.372 position:58% line:91%
and talk about how we could fix this,
how we could make it consistent,

00:24:32.372 --> 00:24:33.821 line:85%
and what we need to do.

00:24:33.821 --> 00:24:36.666 position:64% line:91%
And yeah, I am now going to switch partly
from fact to opinion.

00:24:36.666 --> 00:24:40.593 position:56% line:91%
But actually resolving the question,
talking about why it's this way,

00:24:40.593 --> 00:24:43.354 line:91%
and how to fix it,
is a bit difficult.

00:24:43.354 --> 00:24:46.645 line:91%
And to explain that,
I have to talk about America.

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:54.383 position:72% line:68%
Hi kids! Today we're looking at 301
amazing things about some '90s cartoon series.

00:24:54.383 --> 00:24:57.858 position:91% line:68%
You won't remember it afterwards,
and an hour of your life will have been completely wasted!

00:24:57.858 --> 00:25:01.303 position:78% line:68%
But before that, here's how I keep my family safe:
with <i>The Ring</i> Doorbell.

00:25:01.303 --> 00:25:03.320 line:68%
Not Ring doorbell,
<i>The Ring</i> Doorbell.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.232 line:68%
If someone tries to steal
a package from your porch,

00:25:05.232 --> 00:25:07.518 line:68%
it'll play them a tape that says
they'll die in seven days.

00:25:07.518 --> 00:25:10.858 position:63% line:68%
Then a creepy ghost girl will burst
out of the doorbell and chase them away.

00:25:10.858 --> 00:25:13.713 position:80% line:68%
<i>The Ring</i> Doorbell is available from that weird shop
that you're certain wasn't there

00:25:13.713 --> 00:25:15.200 line:68%
last time you walked
through the neighbourhood.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.208 line:68%
Also it sends a constant live feed
to the local police department.

00:25:18.208 --> 00:25:19.787 position:64% line:85%
The US Federal Communications Commission,

00:25:19.787 --> 00:25:22.727 position:59% line:91%
who regulate over-the-air broadcasts —
among other things — says that:

00:25:22.727 --> 00:25:28.724 position:86% line:91%
<c.cyan><i>Expressions of views that do not involve a
"clear and present danger of serious, substantive evil"</i></c>

00:25:28.724 --> 00:25:31.335 position:72% line:85%
<c.cyan><i>come under the protection of the Constitution.</i></c>

00:25:31.335 --> 00:25:35.230 position:67% line:91%
Freedom of speech is a very, very sensitive
subject for a lot of Americans.

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:39.955 position:77% line:91%
Because the right to freedom of speech is part of
the First Amendment, part of their Constitution,

00:25:39.955 --> 00:25:43.023 line:91%
which often feels like
it's taken as a religious text.

00:25:43.023 --> 00:25:47.962 line:91%
<c.cyan><i>Congress shall make no law...
abridging the freedom of speech...</i></c>

00:25:47.962 --> 00:25:51.270 line:91%
America has "the land of the free"
in their national anthem,

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.943 line:91%
and that includes the freedom
to say whatever you want,

00:25:53.943 --> 00:25:56.572 line:91%
and spend as much money
saying it as you want.

00:25:56.572 --> 00:26:00.904 position:77% line:91%
But despite the reputation,
America does not have complete freedom of speech.

00:26:00.904 --> 00:26:02.556 line:85%
There are a lot of limits to it.

00:26:02.556 --> 00:26:06.015 position:63% line:91%
Here's a list of just some of the things
that you cannot do in America,

00:26:06.015 --> 00:26:09.403 position:67% line:91%
despite the fact that these are technically
limits on freedom of speech.

00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:12.574 position:66% line:85%
Yes, there is "serious evil" in that list.

00:26:12.574 --> 00:26:16.740 position:83% line:91%
But I'm not convinced that someone dropping an F-bomb
on <i>Good Morning America</i> meets that threshold.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.445 line:91%
So sure, in the US you cannot lie
in order to sell a product.

00:26:20.445 --> 00:26:22.993 position:58% line:91%
That falls under "commercial speech",
which the courts say

00:26:22.993 --> 00:26:25.627 position:61% line:91%
doesn't have quite the same protections
under the First Amendment.

00:26:25.627 --> 00:26:28.398 line:91%
If you are endorsing something
as an "influencer"

00:26:28.398 --> 00:26:30.859 line:91%
and not telling the audience
that you've taken money to do it...

00:26:30.859 --> 00:26:34.345 line:91%
It is lying to sell something.
That should be regulated.

00:26:34.345 --> 00:26:39.744 position:75% line:91%
That is a restriction on freedom of speech,
but it seems acceptable to pretty much everyone.

00:26:39.744 --> 00:26:45.278 position:75% line:91%
But because product placement is not a clear
and present danger of serious, substantive evil,

00:26:45.278 --> 00:26:48.470 line:91%
and not fraudulent,
in the US it's allowed by default.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.898 position:66% line:91%
The First Amendment sets a really high bar
for government regulation of speech,

00:26:51.898 --> 00:26:55.117 position:56% line:91%
and something just being "confusing"
doesn't clear it.

00:26:55.117 --> 00:26:58.420 position:59% line:91%
I don't believe that the US regulators
would ever ask TV or film productions

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:00.822 line:91%
to declare their product placement
clearly and up-front.

00:27:00.822 --> 00:27:05.110 position:75% line:91%
And even if they did, I'm pretty sure the courts
would strike it down as Unconstitutional

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.962 position:59% line:91%
the first time one of the broadcasters
challenged it.

00:27:07.962 --> 00:27:12.121 position:64% line:91%
I think the only reason those regulations
still apply to online influencers...

00:27:12.121 --> 00:27:17.113 position:81% line:91%
might be because no individual has the time or money
to file a lawsuit challenging them.

00:27:17.113 --> 00:27:20.211 position:69% line:91%
If the US regulators wanted to be consistent
with the Constitution,

00:27:20.211 --> 00:27:22.368 line:85%
and consistent across all media...

00:27:22.368 --> 00:27:25.236 line:91%
they'd have to massively loosen
the restrictions on influencers,

00:27:25.236 --> 00:27:28.567 position:61% line:91%
to the point where in many cases,
no declarations would be needed at all.

00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:31.385 line:91%
Or maybe you'd just have to put
a tiny mention of the sponsorship

00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:35.244 position:78% line:91%
at the end of the video where no-one would notice,
or down at the bottom of the description.

00:27:35.244 --> 00:27:38.543 position:77% line:91%
I think that's a terrible idea.
I don't think it'd make the world a better place.

00:27:38.543 --> 00:27:42.416 position:70% line:91%
Although it's worth noting that on YouTube,
the platform's regulations would still apply:

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:45.958 position:72% line:91%
they're a private company, so they can require
whatever declarations they want.

00:27:45.958 --> 00:27:47.702 line:85%
And I think they should.

00:27:47.702 --> 00:27:51.588 position:72% line:91%
But that wouldn't affect Instagram, or TikTok,
or Twitter, or anywhere else.

00:27:51.588 --> 00:27:55.099 position:59% line:91%
Short of tearing down the Constitution
and starting over again...

00:27:55.099 --> 00:27:59.851 line:91%
<c.cyan><i>Congress shall make no law...
abridging the freedom of speech...</i></c>

00:27:59.851 --> 00:28:02.646 line:85%
<c.cyan><i>...except for that of corporations.</i></c>

00:28:02.646 --> 00:28:06.106 line:85%
<c.colorCCCCCC><i>[air horns]</i></c>

00:28:06.106 --> 00:28:08.544 line:85%
But, on this side of the Atlantic,

00:28:08.544 --> 00:28:13.134 position:73% line:91%
the default starting point is that free speech
should ideally happen on a level playing field.

00:28:13.134 --> 00:28:18.404 position:78% line:91%
Lawmakers and regulators understand that
money can distort public opinion in terrible ways.

00:28:18.404 --> 00:28:23.954 position:94% line:91%
Britain puts strict financial limits on political campaigns,
and bans political ads from television entirely.

00:28:23.954 --> 00:28:28.039 position:77% line:91%
Those bans have been challenged in court,
and the challenge failed. The restrictions stand.

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:30.223 position:73% line:85%
Yes, they're a limitation on freedom of speech,

00:28:30.223 --> 00:28:32.515 position:72% line:85%
but the British courts — and European courts —

00:28:32.515 --> 00:28:35.980 line:91%
say that letting the people
with money and power say the most

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:40.813 position:83% line:91%
isn't necessarily protecting everyone's free speech —
it might be doing the opposite.

00:28:40.813 --> 00:28:45.660 position:77% line:91%
The ideal over here, according to the regulators,
is meant to be: for-the-good-of-all.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.987 position:64% line:91%
Sneaky advertising like product placement
might not be fair or good for society.

00:28:49.987 --> 00:28:54.073 position:84% line:91%
And over here, it's generally seen as okay to regulate
things like that for the benefit of everyone.

00:28:54.073 --> 00:28:58.205 line:91%
You should have the right to know
when you're being advertised to.

00:28:58.205 --> 00:29:00.342 line:91%
Otherwise, you risk
very rich people and companies

00:29:00.342 --> 00:29:02.680 position:56% line:91%
being able to quietly
influence the world in their favour,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.889 line:85%
even more than they already do.

00:29:04.889 --> 00:29:08.203 line:91%
Those are all obviously
massive simplifications.

00:29:08.203 --> 00:29:10.251 line:91%
Legal scholars will no doubt
be angry at me,

00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:14.609 position:70% line:91%
and anyone who has strong views either way
will be certain that the other side is wrong.

00:29:14.609 --> 00:29:18.631 position:70% line:91%
But in the UK, if it's not very, very obvious
that something is an advert,

00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:19.913 line:85%
it must be clearly marked.

00:29:19.913 --> 00:29:24.223 position:70% line:91%
The rules here used to be that you absolutely
could not mix advertising and content.

00:29:24.223 --> 00:29:26.704 line:91%
That's not the case anymore,
but now at least,

00:29:26.704 --> 00:29:29.093 line:91%
if people could be confused
whether something's an advert,

00:29:29.093 --> 00:29:30.915 line:85%
you have to make it clear.

00:29:30.915 --> 00:29:32.850 line:91%
If a British YouTube video
has product placement,

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.173 line:91%
even just something sitting
in the background of the shot,

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:39.921 position:80% line:91%
the government requires the creator to disclose it,
clearly and up front.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.837 position:73% line:91%
If the UK regulators wanted to make those rules
consistent across all media...

00:29:44.837 --> 00:29:48.660 position:66% line:91%
then they'd have to require that
product placement in movies and television

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.442 position:61% line:91%
also had a clear advertising disclaimer
at the start.

00:29:52.442 --> 00:29:54.238 line:85%
Which seems ridiculous, right?

00:29:54.238 --> 00:29:57.824 position:63% line:91%
As I wrote those words into this script,
it felt ridiculous to me.

00:29:57.824 --> 00:30:01.394 line:91%
And then I thought about it a bit,
and I realised that actually...

00:30:01.394 --> 00:30:03.373 position:64% line:85%
I don't think I have a problem with that.

00:30:03.373 --> 00:30:05.337 line:91%
We already have a ratings system
for movies here.

00:30:05.337 --> 00:30:08.185 position:63% line:91%
If you watch a film in a British cinema,
the distributor is already required

00:30:08.185 --> 00:30:11.835 position:61% line:91%
to add what's called a "black card"
for five seconds just before it starts,

00:30:11.835 --> 00:30:15.447 position:63% line:91%
showing the age rating and the ID number
of the film given by the ratings board.

00:30:15.447 --> 00:30:16.837 line:85%
We've got precedent for this.

00:30:16.837 --> 00:30:20.899 position:81% line:91%
If the regulators wanted to make
advertising disclosures consistent across all media,

00:30:20.899 --> 00:30:24.620 position:67% line:91%
if they thought that the public should know
when they're being advertised to,

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.038 position:72% line:85%
as is apparently their goal for influencers...

00:30:27.038 --> 00:30:32.006 position:84% line:91%
then they should also require a slate that says:
"This film contains advertising from these companies."

00:30:32.006 --> 00:30:35.173 line:91%
And on television, you could change
that tiny, invisible capital-P logo

00:30:35.173 --> 00:30:37.121 line:91%
to be a disclaimer
that can actually be understood.

00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:39.856 position:70% line:91%
Germany's already there:
they don't need the show to name advertisers,

00:30:39.856 --> 00:30:42.538 line:91%
but they do have to
make it very, very clear.

00:30:42.538 --> 00:30:46.220 position:58% line:91%
So I'm not asking for the regulations
on influencers to be loosened,

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.602 position:58% line:85%
because I don't think they should be.

00:30:47.602 --> 00:30:50.930 position:59% line:91%
I think it is misleading if you think
you're watching an entertainment show,

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.221 position:61% line:85%
but you're actually watching an advert.

00:30:53.221 --> 00:30:56.858 position:64% line:91%
I think you should have the right to know
when you're being advertised to,

00:30:56.858 --> 00:31:00.001 line:91%
and that being clear about
who's paying for you to hear things

00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:02.408 position:56% line:85%
helps democracy and society to work.

00:31:02.408 --> 00:31:06.418 position:73% line:91%
I absolutely agree that anyone
making stuff for the internet, myself included,

00:31:06.418 --> 00:31:09.786 line:91%
should have to declare when we've
taken payment to say something.

00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:15.440 position:64% line:91%
I just want the folks who publish offline
to play by the same rules.
