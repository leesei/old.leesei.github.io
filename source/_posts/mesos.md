# Mesos

[Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) [GitHub](https://github.com/mesos)
[Apache Mesos - Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apache_Mesos)

Apache Mesos is inspired by the Google's paper of their Borg system. It abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively. Twitter have been using it since 2007.
Mesos provides the low level API. It usually requires a "framework" (scheduler) to tell it what to do and on which node to execute the task.

It uses Zookeeper underneath for leader election. Non-responsive node will be removed, replace by new node; if the old node response later on the response will be disposed and it will be killed to prevent duplication.

Mesos is best run on bare metal or on VM.

> Mesos is low-level infrastructure; it needs frameworks like Aurora to give it something to do. As David Messina, VP of marketing for Docker, put it in an email, "Aurora is intended for humans to interact with and perform high-level tasks like 'run 100 instances of my service', while Mesos is a toolkit that programmers interact with to build other systems."
