## Ceph

[Ceph (software) - Wikiwand](<https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ceph_(software)>)
[ceph.com](http://ceph.com/)
Ceph is a flexible object storage system, with four access methods: Amazon S3 RESTful API, CephFS, Rados Block Device and iSCSI gateway.

> Note that ceph has several aspects: `rados` is the underlying object-storage, quite solid and libraries for most languages; `radosgw` is an S3/Swift compatible system; `rbd` is a shared-block-storage (similar to iSCSI, supported by KVM, OpenStack, and others); CephFS is the POSIX-compliant mountable filesystem.

[GlusterFS vs. Ceph: Weighing the open source combatants](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/tip/GlusterFS-vs-Ceph-Weighing-the-open-source-combatants) The foundation of Ceph is object storage, that of GlusterFS is a file system.

### iSCSI

Most NAS can expose storage pool as iSCSI LUN over IP.

iSCSI Target: An iSCSI storage server. In this tutorial the target is your NAS.
iSCSI initiator: An iSCSI client. Initiators connect to targets and use their storage.
iSCSI LUN: a portion of storage space that can be utilized by initiators by connecting it to a target. LUNs can be block-based or file-based, though block-based is recommended as it supports more features.

> Warning: Connecting more than one initiator to the same target might result in data loss or damage to the NAS disks.

## XtreemFS

[XtreemFS - Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/XtreemFS)
[XtreemFS - Fault-Tolerant Distributed File System](http://www.xtreemfs.org/)

> I tested XtreemFS and found that it does not work well. There are problems like data corruption ([#359][#359]), read errors in degraded mode ([#357][#357]/[#235][#235]), crippled read-only mode ([#358][#358]) etc.; build system is a mess plus XtreemFS depends on old (not updated since 2007) non-free JAR ([#309][#309], [#173][#173]) so XtreemFS is in violation of DFSG and not distributable in Debian. Also I'm not happy about how devs respond to bugs. Finally XtreemFS is written in poor language notorious for inefficient memory management so naturally XtreemFS can't stand against GfarmFS and LizardFS in performance comparison.
