[Grandi's Series: 1-1+1-1+1... - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yudhkUUzAgY)

A sequence is an ordered list of infinite expressions.
A series a sum of infinite expressions.

When calculating the sum of an series, we look at the sequence of partial sums, defined to be the sum up to the n-th terms. If the limit of the partial sums exists and is bound, we assign the limit as the sum of the series.

We can add, subtract terms by terms of series' by adding and subtracting their values.

Alternatively you can tweak the definition of series, say looking at the sequence of the averages of partial sums, if the limit exists (as in Grandi's Series), it is said to be Cesaro convergent. This trick can be applied repeatedly, look at the sequence of averages of the averages of partial sums. Then some of the previously unbound series are now Cesaro convergent so values can be assigned to it.

When the limit is unbound, the sum of the series is undefined. Applying Riemann Zeta function for s <= 1 with analytic continuation is actually redefining the function for s <= 1. We _do not have to_ make the redefinition to be symmetrical to the s > 1 portion (this is chosen to make the redefinition derivable (analytic)), but if we do, we will _assign_ -1/2 to zeta(-1) and such. It's not actually taking the limit, it's just a way to assign value to the symbol zeta(-1).
Like we (the human race) did to extend rational numbers to real numbers, then to extend real numbers to complex numbers, all of these series will make sense if we relax the axioms.

## Riemann Hypothesis

ζ(s) = 1/1^s+1/2^s+...

s > 1 originally, Riemann ζ function analytically extended the function to complex plane and dropped this restriction

This sum is observed in many physical fields.
