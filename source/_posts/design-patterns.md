## Event Sourcing

[Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)
[Event Store](https://eventstore.org/) The stream database written from the ground up for event sourcing.

Events log is the single source of truth.  
Allows changing schema by replaying event history to get latest state.

## MVC/MVVM/MVP

[Why I No Longer Use MVC Frameworks](https://www.infoq.com/articles/no-more-mvc-frameworks/) !important
MVP is not as flexible as MVVM as the Presenter can only exist with a View.

[Hexagonal Architecture - DEV Community](https://dev.to/abh1navv/hexagonal-architecture-3ocl)
[Android Architecture Components | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture)

A proper Model is ignorant of the ViewModel, and a proper ViewModel is ignorant of the View. However, often a programmer tailors the data types exposed by the ViewModel to the data types associated with particular user interfaces.
