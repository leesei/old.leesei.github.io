This note will focus on the Python binding. Though popular, the Python binding lacks in documentation. Prepare to study its source code and be familiar with OpenCV's C API.
[opencv-python ¬∑ PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) is recommended over the one provided by package manager
[opencv-python-headless ¬∑ PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python-headless/) have less dependencies for headless use, but see [#208 opencv-python-headless requires x11](https://github.com/skvark/opencv-python/issues/208)
