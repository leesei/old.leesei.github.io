[Artificial general intelligence - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Artificial_general_intelligence)

AI is any technology that showcases anything that resembles human intelligence (mimics "cognitive" functions).  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses mathematical models from data to make decisions.
Machine Learning algorithms are trained on large amount of data to minimize the error between their predictions and the actual ground truth values. Deep Learning is a kind of ML which uses deep neural networks. DNN does not requires feature extraction as needed for other traditional DL methods.

AI:

- the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.
- Tasks performed by computers that are normally being performed by human beings with the involvement of visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
- Rule based; heuristics & evolutionary learning

ML:

- Machine learning is an application of Artificial intelligence in which machines learn on their own on the basis of previous experience.
- ML could be considered the subset of Artificial intelligence, just a technique to realize Artificial intelligence.
- Three types of ML algorithms: supervised learning + unsupervised learning + reinforcement learning
- In traditional machine learning (linear or logistic regressions, SMVs, Random Forests and so on), the algorithm is given a set of relevant features to analyze. However, in deep learning, the algorithm is given raw data and decides for itself what features are relevant.
- Algorithms that analyze data, learn from it and make informed decisions based on the learned insights.
  Supervised:
- classification: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machines
- regression (predicting numeric answers): Logistic Regression
  Unsupervised:
- clustering: K-Means, tree-based clustering
- association (finding common sequences of objects: coffee and cream, shoes and socks)
- reduce dimensionality (projection, feature selection, and feature extraction): principal component analysis, tSNE

In **supervised learning**, the algorithm we are working with learns from labeled data. The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to make generalizations about input data based upon data that follows a similar pattern.
**Unsupervised learning** aims to find similar data points in a dataset, in order to identify higher-order structures in the data.
**Reinforcement learning** is similar to supervised learning with the difference being that we're training a pretend actor in the environment.

Classification is performed by supervised learners. A labeled "training data set" is fed to the algorithm for it to learn the relationship of features and classification.
Clustering is usually a task for unsupervised learners. The algorithm is expected to discover patterns in the data automatically provided the features, grouping the data by the patterns it has discovered.

[DeepSORT: Deep Learning to track custom objects in a video](https://nanonets.com/blog/object-tracking-deepsort/)

Face detection is a type of computer vision technology that is able to identify people‚Äôs faces within digital images. Uses AdaBoost, Haar-like Features, Vila-Jones Object Detection Framework.

Facial recognition involves identifying the face in the image as belonging to person X and not person Y. It is often used for biometric purposes, like unlocking your smartphone.

Facial analysis tries to understand something about people from their facial features, like determining their age, gender, or the emotion they are displaying.

Facial tracking is mostly present in video analysis and tries to follow a face and its features (eyes, nose, and lips) from frame to frame.

### categorical variables

It is not advisable to use the ordinal form of categorical variables in clustering, you have to convert them in numeric values which make more sense with rest of the data points, you can use one of the following methods to convert them into numeric form

1. Use 1-hot encoding (So that one category is not influenced by other numerically)
2. If you have classification problem, use target encoding to encode the categorical variables
3. If the categories are ordinal in nature then you may use the label encoding
4. Find the correlation between the categorical variable and all the numeric variables, now replace the mean of the numeric variable value which has the highest correlation with the categorical variable. Correlation can be found using the one-way ANOVA test.

This is especially important in the development of AI. Through a new research approach called TCAV‚Äîor testing with concept activation vectors‚Äîwe‚Äôre working to address bias in machine learning and make models more interpretable. For example, TCAV could reveal if a model trained to detect images of ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù mistakenly assumed that being male was an important characteristic of being a doctor because there were more images of male doctors in the training data. We‚Äôve open-sourced TCAV so everyone can make their AI systems fairer and more interpretable, and we‚Äôll be releasing more tools and open datasets soon.
