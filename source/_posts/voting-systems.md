Like Alternative Voting, but extra votes are given to next alternative.

1. Citizens rank their favorite candidates.
2. Any candidate above the threshold wins immediately,
3. 'Extra' votes go to their next choice.
4. If no winner, last place is eliminated, and the votes to go their next choice.
5. Repeat until all the winners are found.
