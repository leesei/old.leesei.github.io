In cryptography, these entities are usually used:

- Alice, Bob, Charles, Douglas: authentic users
- Eve: eavesdropper
- Mallory: MITM attacker
- Satan: malicious user/hacker

## Algorithms

Bit security measures the number of trials required to brute-force a key. 128 bit security means 2128 trials to break.

### Authenticity

Public Key Cryptography:  
Digital Signatures: encrypt a known data(nounce or message hash) with sender's private key
Certificate Authorities: a trusted third party that will digitally sign and publish the public key bound to a user or entity

## Block Ciphers

### Modes of operation

[Block cipher mode of operation - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation)

Block ciphers, as the name suggests, encrypts blocks. The methods of segmenting data into blocks is called "modes of operation".

[Modes of Operation - Computerphile - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk0NIQfEXBA)
**ECB**: simply divides a message into 16 byte blocks, preserves pattern
**CBC**: first block XORed with Initialisation Vector (IV), every other block XORed with the ciphertext of the block preceding it

## Public Key Cryptography

[Public-key cryptography - Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Public-key_cryptography)  
Public Key crypto simply works with numbers. This means that any messages would have to be converted into a number before being encrypted.

## Enigma Machine

[Enigma machine - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Enigma_machine)
M1 and M3 have 3 rotor slots, M4 has 4 rotor slots.
Each rotor slot houses one of the eight _Rotors_ (labeled in Roman numerals, the extra one for M4 labeled with Greek letters). The right _Rotor_ steps each time a letter is typed. Each _Rotor_ have notches at different positions to cause the _Rotor_ on the left to step when itself done a full revolution, the middle rotor has optional "double stepping" which will also step itself when doing so. The starting _Rotor_ location and order is called _Ground/Order Settings_. The inner ring of each _Rotor_ can be set to a different offset, this is the _Ring Settings_.
There are three choices of _Reflector_ (A, B and C) that takes the input and feed it through the _Rotors_ again.
There is also a _Plugboard_ which will swap two letters before feeding into the _Fixed Rotor_.
The _Reflector_ and _Rotors_ selected, _Ground Settings_, _Ring Settings_ and the _Plugboard_ config have to be kept in sync when encoding and decoding the message. The setting is changed daily and the setting table will change monthly. The operator will send his own _Rotor_ settings using the _Ground Settings_ before each message.
Enigma machine is essentially a symmetric cryptography with the initial setup as key.
