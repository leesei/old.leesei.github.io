[Hardcore History 48 – Prophets of Doom](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/)

Martin Luther in the 16th century criticized the Catholic church for selling indulgence, for reducing one's time spent in purgatory, and got away with it, this move started the Protestant church. Martin translated the Bible from Greek, not the Latin version by the Catholic Church, to vernacular language. He also spread the idea that any one may get revelation from the God and form his own interpretation of the Bible. Luther wanted to reform the Church, not revolt against it.

This is at the watershed of the Dark Age and Renaissance:
the Church was taking the government's role
printing press allowed for widespread of ideas, and heresy, rapidly
Money destabilized social structure:poor blue blood vs rich merchants; decrease in supply of peasants due to plague, there's no market they are bound by law to work for their lord
