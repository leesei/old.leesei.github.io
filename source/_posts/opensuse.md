openSUSE has a decent [package repo](http://software.opensuse.org/421/en) and [Build Service](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Build_Service) (OBS), which is akin to Arch's AUR, but more stable.
The package manager [YaST](https://en.opensuse.org/YaST_Software_Management) is also highly acclaimed.
Tumbleweed is the rolling release and Leap is the stable distro.
