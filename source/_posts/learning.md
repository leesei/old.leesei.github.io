## Google Search

Google is your friend, use it effectively.
When researching on topics (especially technical ones), do keep note of the date of publishing, things changes quickly and what you're referring might be outdated.

## Medium

Many authors now post on Medium, but Medium is not user friendly at all.

I use these extensions:

[The Biggest Myth In Education - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhgwIhB58PA)

**Visual learner**
If you are a visual learner, you love visualizing ideas and concepts. You can create mind maps of the concepts.

**Auditory learner**
If you are an auditory learner, then you are likely to learn by listening to someone talk about the subject.

**Reading/writing learner**
If you are a reading/writing learner, then you are likely to learn from reading programming books and taking notes.

**Kinesthetic learner**
If you are a Kinesthetic learner, then you learn best by doing. You like to engage in learning that involves physically acting out what you have learned.
