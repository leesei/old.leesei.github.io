![Modularize all the things](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e958c48927d8c150b59bd8d4ab2ab2568620822/687474703a2f2f63646e2e6d656d652e616d2f696e7374616e636573322f353030782f3536303334302e6a7067)

Micorservice in short is a _distributed_ modular system. A good Monolith should also be a modular system.

Module and Components are different in the sense that Components are composable. The iPhone charger is a Module but cannot charge an Android phone. Desktop PC hardwares can be interchanged and thus are Components.
Micorservice tends to compose Components, each is an independent Component, as an application.

On an e-Commerse website, Orders, Wishlist, Recommendation, Product Category can all be separate micorservices.
